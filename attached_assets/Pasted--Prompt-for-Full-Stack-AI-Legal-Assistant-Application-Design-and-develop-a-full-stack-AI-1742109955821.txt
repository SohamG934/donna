**Prompt for Full-Stack AI Legal Assistant Application:**  

"Design and develop a **full-stack AI Legal Assistant** named **LexAI**, tailored for Indian legal proceedings, with a Python/FastAPI backend and a modern, law-themed frontend. The application must seamlessly integrate three core functionalities:  
1. **Chat with Legal PDFs** (upload, query, and retrieve context-aware answers).  
2. **Generate Sample Legal Arguments** (based on case details and jurisdiction).  
3. **Indian Legal Database Integration** (free API to search acts, rules, and precedents).  

---

### **Backend Requirements (Python/FastAPI):**  
1. **PDF Chat Engine:**  
   - Use `PyPDF2`/`PDFPlumber` for text extraction and `LangChain` for document splitting.  
   - Implement **RAG pipeline**:  
     - Store embeddings in **ChromaDB**/FAISS.  
     - Use `Llama.cpp` or `HuggingFace` models (e.g., Mistral-7B) for response generation.  
   - API Endpoints:  
     - `/upload-pdf` (file upload with metadata).  
     - `/ask-pdf` (accepts PDF ID + user query, returns AI response with section references).  

2. **Argument Generator:**  
   - Fine-tune a legal-specific LLM (e.g., LaMini-Legal) on Indian case law datasets.  
   - Endpoint `/generate-arguments`:  
     - Accepts `case_details` (JSON: parties, facts, jurisdiction).  
     - Returns structured arguments with citations (IPC, CrPC, Constitution) and confidence scores.  

3. **Legal Database Integration:**  
   - Integrate with **Indian Kanoon API** or a free government legal repository.  
   - Endpoint `/search-law`:  
     - Accepts keywords (e.g., "Section 302 IPC").  
     - Returns act text, amendments, related cases, and summaries.  

4. **Additional Backend Features:**  
   - **User Auth**: JWT-based authentication with OAuth2 for lawyers/clients.  
   - **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests/minute/user to handle API load.  
   - **Logging**: Track queries/responses with `Prometheus` + `Grafana`.

### **Frontend Requirements (React/Next.js):**  
1. **Theme & Style:**  
   - **Color Palette**: Navy blue, gold, and marble white (symbolizing professionalism).  
   - **Animations**:  
     - Subtle floating gavel/hammer in the background (CSS/Three.js).  
     - Courtroom-style wood texture as a section divider.  
     - Page transitions resembling legal document flips.  

2. **Core Components:**  
   - **Dashboard**:  
     - Interactive 3D scales of justice that tilt on hover.  
     - Quick-access cards for PDF Chat, Argument Generator, and Law Search.  
   - **PDF Chat Interface**:  
     - Drag-and-drop PDF uploader with a progress bar styled like a courtroom timer.  
     - Chat window with AI responses displayed on virtual parchment paper.  
   - **Argument Generator**:  
     - Form with dynamic fields (e.g., jurisdiction dropdown, facts textarea).  
     - Generated arguments appear as editable, bookmarked documents with **Bombay High Court** template formatting.  
   - **Law Search**:  
     - Autocomplete search bar with act/rules suggestions.  
     - Results displayed in a scrollable ledger with expandable sections.  

3. **Advanced Features:**  
   - **Voice Input**: Speech-to-text for queries (using Web Speech API).  
   - **Downloadable Drafts**: Save arguments/PDF chats as `.docx` with proper legal formatting.  
   - **Real-Time Collaboration**: WebSocket-based shared session for lawyers to co-edit arguments.

### **Infrastructure & Deployment:**  
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL for user data + Redis for caching frequent API responses.  
2. **Cloud**: Dockerize backend; deploy on AWS EC2/Google Cloud Run.  
3. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.  

---

### **Security & Compliance:**  
1. **Data Encryption**: AES-256 for PDFs and user data.  
2. **Input Sanitization**: Prevent SQLi/XSS attacks in search/queries.  
3. **CORS**: Restrict frontend-backend communication to trusted domains.

### **Inspirational References:**  
- **UI**: Blend the professionalism of `Legaler` with the interactivity of `Casetext`.  
- **Animations**: Mimic the gravitas of `Westlaw` but with modern flair.  

This application should position **LexAI** as an indispensable tool for Indian legal professionals, combining cutting-edge AI with intuitive design to streamline case preparation and research."
